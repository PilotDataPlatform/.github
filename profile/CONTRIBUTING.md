## Styleguides

### Python Development

#### General

- Start with reading PEP 8 for essential rules. Sometimes it’s good to read it several times :slight_smile:.
- Check PEP 257 regarding doc strings formatting.
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 120 characters. This goes in contrast to PEP 8, but this gives more flexibility to write proper variable names or logging strings. Also nowadays most screens do not lack horizontal space.
- Use only UNIX newlines (\n), not Windows style (\r\n).
- When TODO is added it should be either linked to a JIRA issue or contain your name. In this case it’s easier to find the author or track the status. Examples:
```python
# TODO: Here goes a description and a link https://indocconsortium.atlassian.net/browse/PROJECT-ID 

# TODO: Here goes a description and if it doesn't fit one line it continues on a new line
#  with a link https://indocconsortium.atlassian.net/browse/PROJECT-ID

# TODO(yourname): Here goes a description
```
